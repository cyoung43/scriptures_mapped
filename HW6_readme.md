### Chris Young | IS542 | Homework 6

#### Switching the API from XMLHttpRequest to Fetch:
What I thought would initially be an 'easier' homework quickly became more complicated when I ran into errors with the promise object. At first, I could not figure out how to access the resolved promise and send the necessary data to my `scripturesCallback` function. I ended up reading documentation on the Mozilla Developer Network on how I could better use the `fetch` api call and be able to make it work.  
In the class example, we used an explict `function` keyword within the `then` statements to fulfill the api call. Instead of doing this, I found then when I switched to an arrow function, the `fetch` started working better for me and I was able to receive the needed data from the api.  
Another part that I learned was how to use `.then()` chaining. In my first `.then()`, I used similar logic to my old `XMLHttpRequest` to check if I should return json or text. Then I chained a second `.then()` that received the results and sent the data to the correct `successCallback` functions.

#### Comparing project code to Dr. Liddle's solution:
The three things that I learned while comparing my code to Dr. Liddle's were:
1. Continue to 'segment' and break up my code into smaller functions. It seemed that Dr. Liddle's solution was very clean and readable -- each function had a specific job. To me, it didn't seem like any functions did two jobs. If there were two jobs to do, Dr. Liddle created two different functions.
2. Along with number 1, I noticed that I might have 'hardcoded' some of the needed html elements for the previous/next chapter functions and even the breadcrumb navigation as well. I think that I could do a better job of putting those html elements in their own functions and simply invoking those functions at the appropriate time. I think I did that partly with an `icon` function and a `next/previous chapter` function, but I could have done it better for the breadcrumb implementation.
3. I learned that it's important to develop your own code style and 'smell'. Dr. Liddle's code looks different than mine and that is okay! As long as my preferences can still be clean and readable to future developers I can stick with my style.
