#### Chris Young | IS 542 | Project 1
## What I learned:
In this project, I learned how to use the request object to make calls to the api endpoint. This was very interesting because I had never done that before. I think that I am continuing to learn the benefits of modules. I think that I need to review this project to understand each line and what exactly it is doing in the overall function.  
It was also very interesting to work with JSON and see how to navigate it and basically concatenate each of the books to the volumes data.  
I think that I still need to better grasp what the arrow functions are doing with during the `ajax()` call, because I'm just not sure what the data function call is doing.  
Overall, I think that javascript is becoming more a little bit more familiar to me. I recall using the `.foreach()` function on arrays last year in my 413 class. So it's good to know that just like a foreign language, it comes back a little more each time I use it.
